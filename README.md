# missionchat
This is a prototype chatbot for the mission department. It uses the OpenAI API platform. It also is domain specific meaning the chat answers questions related to the mission department.  If someone asks " what do we have for breakfast today" the chatbot will answer with "sorry I can only answer questions related to the mision department".

The chatbot intitiates with 3 frequently asked questions which a user can quickly click and get an answer. Using JavaScript each questions clears after its clicked to prevent clutter  and keep the chat window clean.

The chatbot widget made using css and Javascript can also be minimised and maximised and floats on the right corner of the website.
