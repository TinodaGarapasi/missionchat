# missionchat
This is a prototype chatbot for the mission department. It uses the OpenAI API platform. It also is domain specific meaning the chat answers questions related to the mission department.  If someone asks " what do we have for breakfast today" the chatbot will answer with "sorry I can only answer questions related to the mision department".
